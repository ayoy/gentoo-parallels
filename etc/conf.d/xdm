# We always try and start X on a static VT. The various DMs normally default
# to using VT7. If you wish to use the xdm init script, then you should ensure
# that the VT checked is the same VT your DM wants to use. We do this check to
# ensure that you have't accidently configured something to run on the VT
# in your /etc/inittab file so that you don't get a dead keyboard.
CHECKVT=7

# What display manager do you use ?  [ xdm | gdm | kdm | kdm-3.5 | kdm-4.0 | entrance ]
# NOTE: If this is set in /etc/rc.conf, that setting will override this one.
# KDE-specific note: kdm-3.5 and kdm-4.0 are just examples. You will find all 
# possible versions by looking at the directories in /usr/kde/.
